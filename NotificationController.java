/*The details of this notification is as such :
(1) The notification can be via email or SMS mode.
(2) For email, a actual email will be sent from the application with Subject "Waitlist notification" and message "You have been registered to <Course code>."   Fill the actual data for <Course code>.
(3) For SMS, it will just be a System.out display of "A SMS is sent to <mobileNo>". <mobileNo> is the mobile number recorded in the application.
(4) A Student function for selecting the mode of notification "Select Notification Mode". It can be email, SMS or both. You can also let the user enter the mobile number or email address besides through Admin's "Add Student" function.

About email :
(1) Look at JavaMail and use the API. There are available samples online.
(2) You can create an email account just for this assignment purpose (using coursecode + your labGroup + assignmentGroup should be quite an unique address).
    Change the password after the exam.*/
